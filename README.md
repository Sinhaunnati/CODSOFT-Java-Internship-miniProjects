### 📌 Notes
- Make sure Java is installed and configured in your system environment variables.
- Each project runs independently in the terminal/console.
- The Student Management System reads from and writes to a file named `students.txt`.
- This file will be created automatically in the project directory if it does not already exist.
- Make sure you have write permissions in the directory to allow the program to save data.
